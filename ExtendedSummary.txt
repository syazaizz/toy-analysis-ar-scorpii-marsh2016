## Time-series analysis of AR Sco-like variability ##

In this mini-project, I reproduced the key time-series analysis steps used to study the white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii, 
following the methodology presented in Marsh et al. (2016). The aim was to understand how periodic signals can be extracted 
from noisy astrophysical data and how these techniques distinguish between rotation-powered and accretion-driven variability.

The starting point was a simulated light curve containing a weak periodic signal embedded in stochastic noise, 
representative of high-cadence photometric or radio observations. In the raw time domain, the periodic behaviour is not immediately 
apparent because the intrinsic variability and observational noise dominate the signal. This motivates the use of period-search and 
phase-folding techniques, which are standard tools in time-domain astrophysics.

Using a Lomb–Scargle periodogram, I identified the dominant periodicity in the data. This method is particularly well suited to 
astronomical observations, which are often unevenly sampled. The detection of a strong, narrow peak in the periodogram indicates the 
presence of a coherent, stable periodic signal. In the context of AR Sco, such coherence is interpreted as evidence for rotation-powered 
emission, associated with the white dwarf spin and beat frequencies, rather than accretion processes.

Once the period was identified, the light curve was phase-folded on this period. Phase folding stacks multiple cycles of the signal, 
causing coherent variations to add constructively while random noise averages out. This results in a significant improvement in 
signal-to-noise ratio and reveals the underlying pulse profile. The folded pulse shape and its modulation amplitude provide direct 
information about the emission geometry and physical mechanism powering the variability.

This behaviour contrasts strongly with accretion-driven variability, which typically produces stochastic, aperiodic fluctuations without 
long-term phase coherence. The presence of a stable pulse profile after folding therefore supports a rotation-powered interpretation, 
consistent with the white dwarf pulsar model proposed for AR Scorpii.

Although this analysis was carried out on simulated data, the same workflow applies directly to real observations, including radio 
time-series data from the Very Large Array (VLA). Period searching, phase folding, and quantitative pulse-profile analysis are essential 
techniques for identifying and characterising accreting and explosive radio transients, as well as long-period and white-dwarf pulsar systems. 
This mini-project therefore closely mirrors the analysis techniques required for the advertised PhD project at Warwick and demonstrates 
preparedness for radio time-domain data analysis.

## Toy physical spectral energy distribution (SED) of AR Sco-like emission ##

To complement the time-series analysis, I constructed a simplified, physically motivated spectral energy distribution (SED) to explore how 
different emission mechanisms contribute across frequency for an AR Sco–like system. The goal of this exercise was not to reproduce the 
detailed observational fit of Marsh et al. (2016), but to understand how thermal and non-thermal components combine to produce the broadband 
behaviour observed in white dwarf pulsars.

The toy SED consists of three components: thermal blackbody emission from the M-dwarf companion, thermal emission from the white dwarf, 
and a non-thermal power-law component representing synchrotron radiation. The stellar components were modelled using Planck functions with 
representative temperatures and radii, while the non-thermal component was included to mimic emission from relativistic electrons accelerated 
by the rotating magnetic field of the white dwarf. By constructing each component separately and combining them, I was able to visualise how 
distinct physical processes dominate in different frequency regimes.

The SED was plotted in the standard νF_ν representation, allowing direct qualitative comparison with Figure 4 of Marsh et al. (2016). 
Initially, the model produced unphysically small flux values because it evaluated the Planck function deep into the exponential Wien tail 
without observational normalisation. This was addressed by restricting the frequency range to the observationally relevant regime and rescaling 
the combined SED to a representative flux level. While the resulting model remains a toy description, it correctly reproduces the relative 
dominance of non-thermal synchrotron emission at radio frequencies and thermal stellar emission at optical and ultraviolet frequencies.

This exercise highlights why thermal emission alone cannot explain the observed radio brightness of AR Sco, and why a rotation-powered, non-thermal 
emission mechanism is required. Constructing the SED therefore provides an independent, frequency-domain perspective that complements the time-domain 
analysis, reinforcing the interpretation of AR Sco as a white dwarf pulsar rather than an accretion-powered system.

Although simplified, this toy SED captures the essential physical intuition behind broadband modelling of accreting and explosive radio transients. 
Building and interpreting such models is important in understanding the interplay between time-domain variability and spectral behaviour for 
identifying the physical nature of newly discovered radio transients.
