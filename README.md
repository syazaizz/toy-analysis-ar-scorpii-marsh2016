# Time-Series and Toy SED Analysis of AR Scorpii

This repository contains Python notebooks reproducing the core analysis concepts from
Marsh et al. (2016), “Radio detection of the white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii” (MNRAS 463, 2229).

The project's main focus is to understand how time-domain and broadband analyses distinguish rotation-powered white dwarf pulsars from accretion-driven variability.

# What is done here
1. Time-series analysis (Marsh et al. (2016), Figures 2–3)

- Simulated noisy light curve with a weak periodic signal

- Period detection using a Lomb–Scargle periodogram

- Phase folding to recover a stable pulse profile

This demonstrates how coherent periodic signals are extracted from noisy astrophysical data and why phase coherence supports a rotation-powered interpretation.
